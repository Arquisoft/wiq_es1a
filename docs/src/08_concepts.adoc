== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules


.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== User Interface 

A user interface is the space where a human and a computer or device communicate and exchange information

The user interface is the part of the application that directly interacts with the client, in our case, the player. It should function correctly and be user-friendly.
=== Ergonomics 

Ergonomics is the science of designing and arranging workplaces, products, and systems to fit and adapt to the people who use them. Ergonomics aims to improve comfort, efficiency, and safety by considering human physical and psychological needs and limitations. 

=== Internationalization 

Internationalization is the practice of designing and developing applications that can support multiple languages, formats, and conventions.

Internationalization consists of adapting to the language and culture depending on the location, this is very important as it helps users from different regions to be able to use our game

=== Security 

Security is a broad term that can refer to different aspects of protection, resilience, or prevention of harm. 

A minimum of security in the application is important to save our customers' data
=== Safety  

Is the state of being protected from danger or harm.

=== Build, Test, Deploy 

- Build: This stage involves compiling, validating, and packaging the source code into executable or deployable artifacts. 
- Test: This stage involves running various tests, such as unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests, to ensure the quality and functionality of the software. 
- Deploy: This stage involves delivering or releasing the software to the target environment, such as a server, a cloud platform, or a user device. 

=== Code Generation 

Code generation is the process of creating executable or deployable code from various sources of information, such as natural language, images, or other code.

Generating code makes it easier for the programmer to create functions without wasting a lot of time and simply focusing on the correct implementation of the code, an example is for example generating the getters and setters

=== Migration 

Migrating from one software application or platform to another, such as switching from a legacy system to a modern one, or from a local server to a cloud service.

=== Configurability 

Configurability is the ability to modify or customize something, especially in computing, electronics, or devices

=== Administration 

The process or activity of managing, directing, or organizing something or someone.

Administering an application consists of managing all the resources, users to be able to maintain it in a correct way

=== Management 

Management is the process of organizing and directing the resources of a business or organization to achieve its goals. 

=== Disaster-Recovery 

Is the process of restoring the functionality and data of software applications after a disaster, such as a natural calamity, a cyberattack, or a human error.

It is important to have a plan to recover the data in case of a system failure, it is usually a backup.

=== Architecture and design patterns  

Architecture and design patterns are concepts that help software developers and architects design and build software systems that are efficient, scalable, and maintainable.

Design patterns are important so that your application can scale without cascading changes.
