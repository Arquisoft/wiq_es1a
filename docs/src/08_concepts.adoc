== Cross-cutting Concepts

=== Domain Concepts

This is the actual domain of the application, which is the area of knowledge or activity that the application is designed to support. In this case, the domain is quiz games, which are games that test the player's knowledge on a specific topic.

=== Architecture and Design Patterns

The project follows a microservices architecture, which is a design pattern that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. This makes the application more scalable, flexible, and easier to maintain.

=== User Experience (UX)

==== User Interface 

A user interface is the space where a human and a computer or device communicate and exchange information

The user interface is the part of the application that directly interacts with the client, in our case, the player. It should function correctly and be user-friendly.

==== Ergonomics 

Ergonomics is the science of designing and arranging workplaces, products, and systems to fit and adapt to the people who use them. Ergonomics aims to improve comfort, efficiency, and safety by considering human physical and psychological needs and limitations. 

==== Internationalization 

The application should be able to support multiple languages and regions, so that it can be used by people from different countries and cultures. As of today it has been translated into Spanish and English.

=== Development Concepts

==== Build, Test, Deploy 

The project follows a CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment processes. This ensures that the application is always up-to-date and working correctly. 

==== Configurability

The project has a configuration file that allows the developer to generate new types of questions just by modifying the file. This makes the application more flexible to topic addition.

=== Security and safety

==== Security 

The app REST API verifies the user's identity and permissions before allowing access to the resources. It also prevents sensitive data from being exposed to unauthorized users. This ensures that the application is secure and protects the user's data.

==== Safety

The application has a backup system that automatically saves the user's progress in case of a failure. This ensures that the user's data is always safe and can be recovered in case of a problem.

=== Operation concepts

==== Disaster-Recovery 

App containers have restart policies that automatically restart the container in case of a failure. This ensures that the application is always available and running despite any failures.

==== Monitoring

The application has a monitoring system that tracks the performance and availability of the application. This allows the developer to identify and fix any issues before they affect the user's experience.
