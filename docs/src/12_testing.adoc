=== Load Testing
We used Gatling to perform load testing on the application. It consisted of simulating 1000 users accessing the application at the same time, each of one performing 83 requests. The results of the test are shown below:

As we can see in Gatling's report, the application was able to handle a load of 70868 requests without any problems. In particular, 81% of the requests were successful in less than 800 milliseconds, 6% in more than 1200 milliseconds and 13% were unsuccessful.
