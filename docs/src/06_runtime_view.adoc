=== User plays a game

User selects a game to play. The system loads the game and the user can start playing. The user can pause the game, save it and resume it later. When the game is over, the user can see his score and the game is saved in the user's history.

It should be noted that this does not require access to wikidata data, as the system has a data caching system that allows wikidata data to be stored in the system's database, so it is not necessary to access wikidata every time a game is played.
