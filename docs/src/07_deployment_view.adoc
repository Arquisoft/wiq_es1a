== Deployment View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The deployment view describes:

 1. technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with infrastructure elements like geographical locations, environments, computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other infrastructure elements and

2. mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you should document all relevant environments.

Especially document a deployment view if your software is executed as distributed system with more than one computer, processor, server or container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture only those elements of an infrastructure that are needed to show a deployment of your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and describe an infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture.

.Motivation
Software does not run without hardware.
This underlying infrastructure can and will influence a system and/or some
cross-cutting concepts. Therefore, there is a need to know the infrastructure.

.Form

Maybe a highest level deployment diagram is already contained in section 3.2. as
technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box. In this section one can
zoom into this black box using additional deployment diagrams:

* UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it, probably with nested diagrams,
when your infrastructure is more complex.
* When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams rather than a deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is able to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-7/[Deployment View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Infrastructure Level 1
image::UML.png[UML]

[role="arc42help"]
****
Describe (usually in a combination of diagrams, tables, and text):

* distribution of a system to multiple locations, environments, computers, processors, .., as well as physical connections between them
* important justifications or motivations for this deployment structure
* quality and/or performance features of this infrastructure
* mapping of software artifacts to elements of this infrastructure

For multiple environments or alternative deployments please copy and adapt this section of arc42 for all relevant environments.

_**<Overview Diagram>**_

Motivation::

As we can see, this would be the initial diagram of how the classes would relate to each other. We have, in the first place, the 'app' class that is related to 'link', which in turn is related to the different parts of the app.


=== Infrastructure Level 2

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can include the internal structure of (some) infrastructure elements from level 1.

Please copy the structure from level 1 for each selected element.
****

==== APP

"App": It is the part with which the user interacts. This part would be responsible for providing the visual interface and using the rest of the created classes.

==== LINK

"Link" is the part of the application that connects the rest of the parts. This will facilitate the use of the different parts of the application in the App section.

==== REGISTER

"Register" is the part of the application that handles user registration and login. It's very important as it's the first thing a potential user will encounter when they visit our page.

==== USER SERVICE

"User service" is the part of the application that generates the various services within the application to the user, such as a ranking, correctly answered questions, and so on.

==== QUESTION GENERATOR

"Question generator" is the part of the application that, using the data from Wikidata and some pre-created templates, generates the questions and possible answers of the application.

==== WIKIDATA

Wikidata‚Äù is the API that you will use to obtain the data for the questions. Wikidata is a free and collaborative database that can be read and edited by both humans and machines. It provides a common source of certain types of data that can be used by Wikimedia projects.
